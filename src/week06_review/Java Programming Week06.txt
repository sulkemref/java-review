Loops: Repeated Action
    
    For loop: When the repetition is fixed

                     i =0;  i < length
                for(init; condition; i++){
                    code
                }

                RemoveDuplicates



    While loop: When the repetition is NOT fixed
                repeated If
                
                while(Condition){
                    code
                }

                if(Condition){
                    code
                }


    Do-While loop: When the repetition is NOT fixed
                    Loop MUST be executed at least once


                do{
                    code
                }while(Condition);


    Nested loop: loop inside another loop


            Frequency Task



Class: template of objects. determines how the object should be created, contains & behave
                    indicates all the attributes & actions the objects of the class need

               instance variables: belong to the object
                                    each object has its own copy of the instance variable
               
               instance methods: belong to the object
                                each object has its own copy

                    instance: multiple copies
                    static: one copy ONLY




Object: instance of the class. has its own memory
