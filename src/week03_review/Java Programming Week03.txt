Logical Operators: &&, ||, !

    &&: and. both must be true in order to return true.

        In order to login: BOTH username AND password must be correct

    ||: or. Either. only one condition need to be true in order to return true

        In order to login to github: EITHER the username OR email need to be provided

    !: not. opposite

            not Valied: !Valid
            not Eligible: !Eligible
            not passed: !Passed

If Statements: Conditional Statements
    
    Single If: for one condition

                if(Condition){
                    Statements
                }

    If & Else: 2 possible conditions ONLY ( not more not less)

            if(ConditionA){
                StatementA
            }else{ //!ConditionA
                StatementB
            }

    Multi-branch If: for 3 or more conditions

            if(ConditionA){
                StatemntA
            }else if(ConditionB){
                StatementB
            }else{
                StatementrC
            }

        StatementA: ConditionA is true
        StatementB: ConditionA is false, ConditionB is true
        StatementC: ConditionA & ConditionB are false


    Nested If: for pre-conditions

                mandatory step

            if(Pre-Condition1){

                If & Else

            }else{

                Muli-branch If
            }



    A, B, C, D, F



        If the mall is open:

If WebDriver is installed:

            open chromer browser....

    If browser name is set Safari:

    If browser name is set Firfox:
            open firefix browser....

Ternaries: shoortcut of if statements
        
        ? if keyword
             (Condition)? value

        : else keyword
                : value

        :? else if
                :(Condition)? value


        TOTAL NUMBER OF ? AND : MUST BE EVEN


.equalsIgnoreCase() , contains(), startsWith() ..... >, < , <= , !=


Swicth: 

    ==, .equals()

    
    switch (expression){ //MUST be evaluated to a single value (can not be long, float, double, boolean)

        case caseValue1:
                StatementA
                break;           

        case caseValue2:
            StatementB
            break;

        ....

        default:
            StatementC


    }

    SWITCH statement looks for EXACT MATCH only

    caseValue MUST BE unique AND must match with the data type of switch' expression



{}

Scanner: get user input & read files

    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

    nextInt(): for int inputs
    nextDouble(): for double inputs

    next(): for String inputs (till firstspace)
    nextLine(): for String inputs (whole line)
