package name: week11_review


Inheritance: building IS A relationship between classes (super & sub or parent & child)

        child class (sub): inherits all the variables & methods (visible) from the parent class

                    Constructor can not be inherited

        parent class (super): can not inherit anything from child. contain all the common variables and methods that are meant t be inherited to ALL the child classes

        Advantages:
            less codes
            less memory usage
            clean codes
            reusability
            easy to maintain


this: refers to the instances. current class
    this. : calls instance variables or instance methods
    this(): calls the constructor

super: refers to the instances, parent class
    super.  : calls instance variables or instance methods
    super() : calls the constructor


Method Overriding: giving different implementations to the method
                    
                   MUST happen in child class

                   return-type, parameters, method name need to be same

                   Access moodifier must be same or more visible


Inheritance Practice Task:
    1. Create a class named Person:
            Variables:
                name, age, gender

            Encapsulate all the fields
                restrictions for the fields:
                    name can not be empty
                    name can not be null
                    age can not be negative
                    age can not be zero

            Add a constructor to set all the fields
                (Make sure all the restrictions are applied)

            Methods:
                eat()
                drink()
                sleep()
                toString()


    2. Create a sub-class of Person named Employee:

            Extra variables:
                employeeId (String), jobTitle, salary

            Encapsulate all the fields
                restrictions for the fields:
                    job title can not be empty
                    job title can not be null
                    salary can not be negative
                    salary can not be zero
                    employee id can not start with the character '0'

            Add a constructor to set all the fields
                (Make sure all the restrictions are applied)

            Methods:
                work()
                toString()


    3. Create a sub-class of Person named Student
            Extra variables:
                studentId, fieldOfStudy, schoolName, grade

            Encapsulate all the fields
                restrictions:
                    fieldOfStudy can not 

            Add a constructor to set all the fields

            Encapsulate all the fields

            Methods:
                study()
                toString()


    4. Create the following sub-classes of Employee and override the work method:

            4.1 Tester:
                    additional methods:
                        smokeTesting()

            4.2 Developer:
                    additional methods:
                        unitTesting()

            4.3 Teacher

            4.4 Janitor

    5. Create the following sub-classes of Student and override the study method

            5.1 GraduateStudent

            5.2 UnderGraduateStudent

            5.3 CydeoStudent
                    Additional Variables:
                        batchNum, groupName, progLanguage

                        Encapsulate all the fields
                            restrictions for the fields:
                                batch number can not be zero or negative
                                groupName can not be empty or null
                                groupName can not start with a digit or special characters
                                progLanguage must be set to one of the followings:
                                    {"Java", "Python", "JavaScript"}

                    Override the toString method to make sure that batchNum, groupName, progLanguage are included when the object of CydeoStudent is printed
'java'
