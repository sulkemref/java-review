Java Programming Week08

Review Topics:  ArrayList
                Array vs ArrayList

package name: week08_review

3 data structure:
        1. Array: size is fixed. faster. supports both primitive & non primitives
        2. Collection: size is dynamic. ONLY support non-primitives
        3. Map: size is dynamic. ONLY support non-primitives


ArrayList: part of collection. Internally uses array
        has index numbers


ArrayList vs Array: Both has index numbers
                    Elements are easier to access
                    Elements can be updated

            Array: accepts primitives 
                   does not support insertion/deletion of the element
                   can be multi-dimensional
                   Faster


            ArrayList: does not accept primitives
                        supports insertion/deletion of the element
                        can not be multi-dimensional
                        Slower

                        Methods

    Remove methods of arrayList:
        1. remove(): When we need to remove one element. DO NOT use it in a loop

        2. removeAll(): when we need to remove multiple elements and those elements are known
        3. retainAll(): when we need to retain multiple elements (Must be known) and remove the rest.

        4. removeIf(): when we need to remove multiple elements under the conditions


Tasks:
    1. Write a program that can return the first unique elements from an arraylist

            Do not use indexOf & lastIndexOf methods


    2. Write a program that can remove string elements from an arraylist if the first and last characters of the string are same
    ex:
        list = {"Anna", "Canada", "Bob", "David", "Lan", "Abida", "Ebrahim", "Farida"}
    output:
        ["Lan", "Ebrahim", "Farida"]


    3. write a program that can return the nth largest number from an arraylist
            ex:
                arraylist = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8,8}
                n = 5
            output:
                4

    4. Write a program that can return the unique characters from a string

            DO NOT use:
                for loop, for each loop, while loop, do while loop
