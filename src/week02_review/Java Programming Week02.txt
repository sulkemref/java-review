Review Topics:
    1. Primitive castings
    2. Concatenation
    3. Operators: 
            Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
            shorthand: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
            unary: --, ++, 
            relational
            logical

    4. If Statements

Concatenation vs Addition: +
			
			Addition:
				number + number

			Concatenation:
				text + any data 
				any data + text
				text + text




Arithmetic Operators:
	+: Addition
			"200" + 500 = "200500"

			500 + 400 = 900

	-: Subtraction

			1000 - 300 = 700

	*: Multiplication

			20 * 5 = 100

			2.5 * 2 = 5.0

	/: division

			10 / 2  = 5

			10 / 3 = 3


	%: remainder

		in math:  20 / 8 = 2.5

				remainder = 20 - (8 * 2)
				remainder = 4

		in java: 20 % 8 ==> 4


				100 / 28 = 3.57

				remainder = 100 - (28*3)
				remainder =  100 - 84
				reaminder = 16


				100 % 28 ===>16



Logical Operatirs:
		
		||: or. only ONE condition need to be true in order to return true


		&&: and. both condition must be true, in order to return true 





If Statements: Conditional statements. decision makings

	single if: creating conditions for one possible output

			if(Boolean Condition){
					statements
			}

	if & else: creating conditions for 2 possible outputs. NOT MORE NOT LESS THAN 2 CONDITIONS

			if(Boolean Condition){

			}else{ // !

			}



	multi-branch if

	nested if

	ternary
