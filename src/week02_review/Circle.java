/*
Create a class named Circle and declare the following variables:
                radius
                area
                perimeter

    Write a program that can calculate the area and perimeter of a circle with any given radius
            Ex:
                  radius = 5
            output:
                   Area of the circle is 78.5
                   Perimeter of the circle is 31.4
